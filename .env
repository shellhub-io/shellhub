# Specifies the network name utilized by Docker Compose. As all services (except for the gateway and SSH) persistently operate
# on the port 8080, running multiple instances may result in collision errors.
#
# To illustrate, envision two distinct ShellHub instances denoted as "A" and "B". In instance "A", a gateway operates on port
# 11111, and in instance "B", a gateway operates on port 22222. Since both APIs function on port 8080 and both instances
# share the same network, gateway "A" might inadvertently request data from "B" (and vice versa) when the networks are identical.
