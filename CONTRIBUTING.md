# Contributing to ShellHub

ShellHub is an open source project and we love to receive
contributions from our community.

Here are a few general guidelines on contributing and reporting bugs
to ShellHub that we ask you to take a look first.  Notice that all of
your interactions in the project are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting Issues

Before reporting a new issue, please be sure that the issue wasn't
already reported or fixed by searching on GitHub through our
[issues](https://github.com/ShellHub-io/shellhub/issues).


## Submitting Changes

* Check for open issues, or open a fresh issue to start a discussion
  around a feature idea or a bug. Opening a separate issue to discuss
  the change is less important for smaller changes, as the discussion
  can be done in the pull request.
* Fork the relevant repository on GitHub, and start making your
  changes.
* Check out the README for the project for specific information to
  that repository.
* Push the change to a separate branch for your feature.
* Open a pull request.
* We try to merge and deploy changes as soon as possible, or at least
  leave some feedback.
