            The cloud/ (enterprise) repo is checked out at $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/cloud/ for context.
            Focus the review on the shellhub diff. Use cloud/ only to understand cross-repo impact.

            ## Progress Tracking

            A progress comment (ID: ${{ steps.progress.outputs.comment_id }}) has been created on the PR.
            Update it at each major phase. Every update MUST include `<!-- claude-code-review -->`
            at the start of the body so re-reviews can find it.

            To update it, always follow this two-step pattern:
            1. Use the **Write** tool (NEVER echo/printf/bash) to create /tmp/comment.md.
               This is critical — bash escapes `!` in `<!-- -->`, breaking the hidden marker.
            2. Post it with Bash:
               gh api "repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/comments/${{ steps.progress.outputs.comment_id }}" -X PATCH -F body=@/tmp/comment.md

            Never use -f body="..." with inline content — newlines will be lost.

            You MUST update the progress comment after every step — do not skip or batch them.
            If an update fails, continue with the review but still attempt subsequent updates.
            If the comment ID above is empty (step failed), skip all progress updates and
            fall back to posting the final summary with `gh pr comment` instead.

            ## Step 1: Gather context

            1. Get the PR diff:
               gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number }}
            2. Get the list of changed files:
               gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number }} --json files
            3. Fetch ALL existing review comments to avoid duplicating feedback:
               gh api repos/shellhub-io/shellhub/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number }}/comments
               gh api repos/shellhub-io/shellhub/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number }}/reviews

            After completing this step, update the progress comment:
            - [x] Gathered PR context (N files changed)
            - [ ] Reviewing with 5 specialized agents
            - [ ] Posting feedback

            ## Step 2: Spawn 5 reviewer agents IN PARALLEL

            Launch exactly 5 Task agents in a SINGLE message (so they run in parallel).
            Each agent MUST use model: "opus". Each agent gets:
            - The PR diff (pass it in the prompt)
            - The list of changed files
            - Read access to the full codebase (current directory for shellhub, $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/cloud/ for cloud)

            Agent assignments:
            1. **Code Quality**: Project conventions (CLAUDE.md), dead code, single responsibility, error handling, commit hygiene
            2. **Security**: OWASP Top 10 (injection, XSS, CSRF, SSRF), hardcoded secrets, crypto/rand usage, access control, input validation
            3. **Testing**: Missing tests for new/changed behavior, edge cases, test determinism, untested error paths
            4. **Go/TypeScript Patterns**: Error wrapping (%w), goroutine leaks, context propagation, minimal interfaces, React patterns (no `any`, no unnecessary re-renders, Zustand)
            5. **Architecture & Cross-repo**: If PR changes pkg/, check $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/cloud/ for impact. API contract changes, interface compatibility, breaking changes.

            Each agent must return findings as a structured list:
            - file_path: exact path relative to repo root
            - line_start and line_end: exact line numbers in the NEW file
            - severity: critical | high | medium | low
            - description: what's wrong and why
            - suggestion: corrected code (if applicable), or empty string

            General instructions for ALL agents:
            - Be exhaustive. Report every issue you find regardless of severity. Do not
              stop after finding the most obvious problems.
            - Do at least two passes: first for structural/logic issues, then for edge
              cases and defensive coding.
            - For each suggestion you make, verify it is correct: check that all
              referenced variables exist, all event fields are available for every
              trigger type, token permissions are sufficient, and your fix does not
              introduce new issues.
            - Check consistency: if you find an issue in one place, scan for the same
              pattern elsewhere in the diff and report all occurrences.
            - Consider all GitHub Actions trigger types this workflow handles
              (pull_request_target, issue_comment, pull_request_review,
              pull_request_review_comment) and verify each code path works for all of
              them.

            Agents must NOT post any GitHub comments. They only return findings.

            After all agents complete, update the progress comment:
            - [x] Gathered PR context (N files changed)
            - [x] Code review complete
            - [ ] Posting feedback

            ## Step 3: Aggregate and deduplicate

            After all 5 agents complete, collect their findings. Then:
            1. Remove duplicate findings (same file + same line range + same issue)
            2. If the same pattern repeats across multiple locations, keep only the first occurrence and note "Same issue also at: file:line, file:line, ..."
            3. Compare against the existing review comments fetched in Step 1. Skip any finding already reported in a previous review thread on the same file and line.

            ## Step 3.5: Cross-validate findings

            Before posting, do a final review pass:
            1. For each finding with a suggestion, verify the suggested fix is correct
               and complete — does it handle all trigger types? Does it use the right
               token? Does it introduce any new issues?
            2. For each finding, check if the same pattern exists elsewhere in the diff
               that wasn't reported. If so, add those locations.
            3. Read the full diff one more time specifically looking for: missing error
               handling, missing fallbacks for optional event fields, inconsistent
               patterns between similar code blocks, and defensive coding gaps
               (continue-on-error, || true, fail-closed defaults).

            ## Step 4: Post inline comments

            For each remaining finding, post an inline comment using
            mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment on the specific file and line.

            When a fix is available, include a GitHub suggestion block:
            ```suggestion
            corrected code here
            ```

            Do NOT re-report issues that already exist in previous review threads.

            After posting all inline comments, update the progress comment:
            - [x] Gathered PR context (N files changed)
            - [x] Code review complete
            - [x] Posted N inline comments
            - [ ] Finalizing summary

            ## Step 5: Update final summary

            After Step 4 is complete, update the progress comment one final time to become
            the closing summary. Do NOT post a separate comment with `gh pr comment` —
            transform the existing progress comment in place.

            When mentioning `/review` in any comment, always wrap it in backticks (`` `/review` ``).

            The PR author ${{ steps.author-check.outputs.is_admin == 'true' && 'IS' || 'is NOT' }} a member of the shellhub-io/admin team.

            ### If there are findings:

            Update the progress comment to:

                <!-- claude-code-review -->
                ## Code Review Complete

                Reviewed N files. **X inline issues** posted (breakdown by severity).

                ### Additional notes
                (Only if there are non-inlinable findings — architectural concerns,
                missing files, cross-cutting issues not tied to specific lines.
                Omit this section entirely if all findings were posted inline.)

                {For non-admin authors:}
                If you've addressed the feedback and want a new review, tag
                `@shellhub-io/admin` and a team member can trigger it.

            ### If there are NO findings:

            Update the progress comment to:

                <!-- claude-code-review -->
                ## Code Review Complete

                Reviewed N files across code quality, security, testing, language patterns,
                and architecture — no issues found. The code looks good as-is.

                {For non-admin authors only:}
                If you push additional changes and want a new review, tag
                `@shellhub-io/admin` and a team member can trigger it.

            Do NOT mention inline comments or `/review` follow-up when there are no findings
            (unless the author is non-admin, in which case include the tag guidance).

            In both cases, always update the progress comment. Never skip Step 5.
