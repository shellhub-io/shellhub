## Infrastructure as Code for Device Management

We're excited to announce the official ShellHub Terraform Provider. Now you can manage your entire ShellHub configuration — namespaces, firewall rules, public keys, and device tags — using the same infrastructure-as-code workflow you use for the rest of your stack.

## Quick Example

```hcl
provider "shellhub" {
  api_url = "https://cloud.shellhub.io"
  api_key = var.shellhub_api_key
}

resource "shellhub_namespace" "production" {
  name       = "production-devices"
  max_devices = 100
}

resource "shellhub_firewall_rule" "allow_ops" {
  namespace_id = shellhub_namespace.production.id
  priority     = 1
  action       = "allow"
  source       = "ops-team"
  username     = ".*"
  hostname     = ".*"
}
```

## Why Terraform?

If your team already uses Terraform for managing cloud infrastructure, adding ShellHub to your workflow is natural. You get:

- **Version control** for access policies
- **Reproducible** environments across staging and production
- **Drift detection** when someone makes manual changes
- **Plan and review** before applying changes

## Getting Started

Install the provider and check our documentation for the full resource reference.

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

The provider is open source and available on the Terraform Registry.
