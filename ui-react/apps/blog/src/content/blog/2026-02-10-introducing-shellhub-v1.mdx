## A Long Journey

ShellHub started as a simple idea: what if you could SSH into any Linux device, anywhere, without worrying about firewalls, NATs, or VPNs?

Today, that idea is a reality. ShellHub v1.0 is the culmination of years of work by our team and community.

## What's New in v1.0

### Production-Ready Stability

We've hardened every component of the platform. The gateway, API, SSH server, and agent have all been battle-tested in production environments managing thousands of devices.

### Enhanced Security

- **Public key authentication** with centralized key management
- **Firewall rules** to control who can access which devices
- **Session recording** for audit trails
- **MFA support** for an extra layer of security

### Improved Performance

The new connection multiplexing in the SSH gateway reduces latency by up to 40% compared to previous versions. File transfers are also significantly faster thanks to optimized buffering.

## Getting Started

Getting started with ShellHub is straightforward:

```bash
curl -sSf https://cloud.shellhub.io/install.sh | sh
```

Or if you prefer self-hosted:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## What's Next

We have an exciting roadmap ahead:

- **Web terminal improvements** with better rendering and copy/paste
- **API v2** with GraphQL support
- **Kubernetes operator** for cloud-native deployments
- **Plugin system** for extending ShellHub functionality

Thank you to everyone who contributed to making this release possible. We couldn't have done it without our amazing community.
