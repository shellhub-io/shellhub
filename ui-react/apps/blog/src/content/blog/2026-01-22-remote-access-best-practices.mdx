## The Challenge of Remote Access

Managing remote access to hundreds or thousands of IoT devices presents unique challenges. Unlike traditional servers in a data center, IoT devices are often behind NATs, firewalls, or cellular networks with no static IP.

## Key Principles

### 1. Never Expose SSH Directly

Opening port 22 to the internet is a recipe for disaster. Instead, use a reverse tunnel or gateway approach where devices connect outbound to a central server.

### 2. Centralize Authentication

Managing SSH keys across hundreds of devices manually is unsustainable. Use a centralized platform that distributes keys and manages access policies from a single control plane.

### 3. Implement Least Privilege

Not every team member needs root access to every device. Implement role-based access control and firewall rules to limit who can connect to which devices.

### 4. Record Everything

Session recording provides an audit trail that's invaluable for debugging issues and ensuring compliance. Every SSH session should be logged with full terminal output.

## ShellHub's Approach

ShellHub was designed from the ground up with these principles in mind:

```
Device → Agent (outbound connection) → Gateway → User
```

The agent initiates the connection, so no inbound ports are needed. Authentication is centralized, and every session is recorded by default.

## Conclusion

Secure remote access doesn't have to be complicated. By following these principles and using the right tools, you can manage thousands of devices without compromising security.
