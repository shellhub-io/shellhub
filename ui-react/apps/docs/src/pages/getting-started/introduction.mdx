# Introduction

ShellHub is a centralized SSH gateway that gives you remote access to Linux devices over the internet. No public IPs, no VPNs, no firewall changes.

## The problem

Managing SSH access to remote Linux devices is painful. Traditional setups require public IPs, open firewall ports, VPN tunnels, or jump hosts. That works for a handful of servers in a data center — it falls apart when you're dealing with devices behind NAT, CGNAT, or strict corporate firewalls.

If you manage edge devices, IoT gateways, or distributed servers, you've likely dealt with at least one of these:

- Devices behind carrier-grade NAT with no inbound connectivity
- VPN configurations that break when networks change
- Firewall rules that need to be maintained per device
- Jump hosts that become single points of failure
- No visibility into who connected to what, and when

## How ShellHub solves it

ShellHub reverses the connection model. Instead of opening inbound ports on each device, you install a lightweight agent that connects **outbound** to the ShellHub server over HTTPS (port 443). You then access your devices through the ShellHub gateway using a web terminal or your standard SSH client.

The agent initiates the connection from the device side, so it works behind any network topology — NAT, CGNAT, firewalls, proxies. The device never needs a public IP or an open inbound port.

The result:

- **No inbound ports** — Devices connect outbound, so no firewall rules needed
- **No VPN** — Access devices directly through the gateway
- **No public IPs** — Works behind NAT, CGNAT, and corporate firewalls
- **One entry point** — A single URL to reach all your devices
- **Full audit trail** — Every connection is logged with user, device, and timestamp

## What you can do

For details on each feature, see the [Features](/v2/docs/getting-started/features) page.

- **Web terminal** — Open an SSH session from your browser, no client needed
- **Native SSH** — Use OpenSSH, PuTTY, or any SSH client with the device's SSHID
- **SCP and SFTP** — Transfer files to and from devices
- **Public key auth** — Manage SSH keys centrally with per-device and per-user control
- **Firewall rules** — Define who can connect to which devices, from which IPs
- **Session recording** — Record and replay terminal sessions for auditing
- **Device tagging** — Organize devices with labels and filter by tag
- **Multi-tenant** — Isolate devices and teams into namespaces with role-based access
- **Container access** — SSH into Docker containers running on your devices
- **MFA** — Add a second factor to user authentication
