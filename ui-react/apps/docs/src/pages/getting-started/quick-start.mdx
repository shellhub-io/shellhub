# Quick Start

This guide gets you from zero to your first SSH session through ShellHub. Pick your path:

- **[ShellHub Cloud](#shellhub-cloud)** — Fastest way. No server setup, start in 2 minutes.
- **[Self-Hosted](#self-hosted)** — Run ShellHub on your own infrastructure with Docker Compose.

Both paths end the same way: installing the agent on a device, accepting it, and connecting via SSH.

---

## ShellHub Cloud

### 1. Create an account

Go to [cloud.shellhub.io](https://cloud.shellhub.io) and sign up. Verify your email when prompted.

After logging in, you'll be asked to create a **namespace** — this is your workspace that groups your devices, team members, and settings.

### 2. Install the agent

In the dashboard, click **Add Device**. You'll get the install script command:

```bash
$ curl -sSf "https://cloud.shellhub.io/install.sh?tenant_id=YOUR_TENANT_ID" | sh
```

Run this on any Linux device you want to manage. The agent installs as a Docker container and connects to ShellHub automatically.

> **Tip:** The agent needs Docker or Podman on the device. For other installation methods (Snap, FreeBSD, Buildroot, Yocto), see [Agent](/v2/docs/agent/overview).

### 3. Accept the device

Back in the dashboard, the device appears with **Pending** status. Click **Accept** to approve it.

### 4. Connect

Click the terminal icon next to the device to open a web SSH session. Enter the device username and password — you're in.

To connect with your own SSH client:

```bash
$ ssh username@hostname.namespace@cloud.shellhub.io
```

Replace `username` with the device user, `hostname` with the device name shown in the dashboard, and `namespace` with your namespace name.

You should see the device's shell prompt. If you get a connection error, check that the device status shows **Online** in the dashboard.

**Done.** You now have remote SSH access to your device through ShellHub.

## Self-Hosted

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 20.10+
- Docker Compose v2
- A Linux host with at least 1 GB of RAM
- Ports 80 and 22 available (configurable)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/shellhub-io/shellhub.git
$ cd shellhub
```

### 2. Generate keys

ShellHub uses cryptographic keys for device authentication:

```bash
$ make keygen
```

### 3. Start the services

```bash
$ make start
```

First run pulls container images and takes a few minutes. Once done, all services are running.

### 4. Create your account

Run the setup script to generate a setup URL:

```bash
$ ./bin/setup
```

Open the generated URL in your browser. Create your admin account and choose a namespace name.

### 5. Install the agent

In the dashboard, click **Add Device** and copy the install command:

```bash
$ curl -sSf "http://YOUR_SERVER/install.sh?tenant_id=YOUR_TENANT_ID" | sh
```

Run this on the Linux device you want to manage. Replace `YOUR_SERVER` with your ShellHub server's address.

### 6. Accept the device

The device appears with **Pending** status in the dashboard. Click **Accept**.

### 7. Connect

Click the terminal icon to open a web session, or use your SSH client:

```bash
$ ssh username@hostname.namespace@your-server.com
```

You should see the device's shell prompt. If you get a connection error, check that the device status shows **Online** in the dashboard.

**Done.** Your self-hosted ShellHub instance is running and your first device is connected.

### Configuration

Customize the deployment with a `.env.override` file in the project root:

```bash
SHELLHUB_HTTP_PORT=8080
SHELLHUB_SSH_PORT=2222
SHELLHUB_DOMAIN=shellhub.example.com
SHELLHUB_AUTO_SSL=true
```

See [Configuring](/v2/docs/self-hosted/configuring) for the full reference.

### Stopping

```bash
$ make stop
```

Data persists in Docker volumes. Your devices and configuration survive restarts.
