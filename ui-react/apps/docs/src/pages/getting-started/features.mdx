# Features

Here's what ShellHub offers for remote device access, organized by capability.

## Native SSH support

Connect to any registered device using your existing SSH client — OpenSSH, PuTTY, JuiceSSH, or any tool that speaks SSH. No plugins, no custom clients. Just use the device's [SSHID](/v2/docs/getting-started/how-it-works#sshid) as the target:

```bash
$ ssh root@device.namespace@cloud.shellhub.io
```

ShellHub acts as a transparent SSH proxy. Your SSH client connects to the ShellHub server, which routes the session to the correct device through the agent's tunnel.

## Web terminal

Open an SSH session directly from your browser. Click the terminal icon next to any device in the dashboard, enter credentials, and you're connected. No SSH client installation needed.

The web terminal uses xterm.js for a full terminal experience with copy/paste, scrollback, and resizable panes.

## SCP and SFTP

Transfer files to and from your devices using standard SCP and SFTP tools:

```bash
$ scp myfile.txt root@device.namespace@cloud.shellhub.io:/tmp/
$ sftp root@device.namespace@cloud.shellhub.io
```

Works with any SCP/SFTP client — FileZilla, WinSCP, or the command-line tools you already use.

## Public key authentication

Upload SSH public keys to ShellHub and control which keys can access which devices. Keys can be scoped with filters:

- **By username** — Restrict a key to specific usernames on the device
- **By hostname** — Limit access to specific devices by name
- **By tag** — Apply keys to groups of devices using tags

This gives you centralized key management without manually copying `authorized_keys` files to each device.

## Firewall rules

Define connection policies that control who can SSH into which devices. Rules are evaluated by priority and can match on:

- **Source IP** — Allow or deny connections from specific IPs or ranges
- **Username** — Restrict which usernames can be used
- **Device** — Apply rules globally, to specific hostnames (regex), or by tag

Firewall rules let you enforce access policies across your entire fleet from a single dashboard.

> **Note:** Available on Cloud and Enterprise editions.

## Audit logging

Every SSH connection is recorded with metadata:

- Who connected (username and IP)
- Which device they accessed
- Authentication method used (password, key)
- Session start and end time
- Whether authentication succeeded or failed

The audit log gives you visibility into all access activity across your devices.

> **Note:** Available on Cloud and Enterprise editions.

## Session recording

Record terminal sessions and play them back from the dashboard. Session recording captures the full terminal output, so you can review exactly what happened during a session — useful for compliance, incident investigation, or training.

> **Note:** Available on Cloud and Enterprise editions.

## Container remote access

SSH directly into Docker containers running on your devices, not just the host. The agent can expose containers as individually addressable devices in the ShellHub dashboard.

This is useful for accessing application containers, debugging services in production, or managing multi-container setups on edge devices.

> **Note:** Available on Cloud and Enterprise editions.

## HTTP tunnels

Access web services running on your devices through encrypted HTTP tunnels. If a device runs a web dashboard, API, or monitoring service on a local port, ShellHub can expose it through a secure tunnel — no port forwarding needed.

The tunnel is encrypted even if the underlying service uses plain HTTP, so you get secure access to device-local web interfaces from anywhere.

> **Note:** Available on Cloud and Enterprise editions.

## Device tagging

Assign up to 3 tags per device to organize your fleet. Tags are free-form labels — use them for environment (`production`, `staging`), location (`warehouse-a`, `office`), role (`gateway`, `sensor`), or any classification that fits your workflow.

Tags integrate with firewall rules and public key filters, so you can apply policies to groups of devices instead of managing them one by one.

## Multi-factor authentication

Add TOTP-based MFA to user accounts. ShellHub supports standard authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, 1Password, Authy) and provides recovery codes for backup access.

> **Note:** Available on Cloud and Enterprise editions.

## Namespaces and team management

Organize devices into namespaces with role-based access for team members:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access including billing and namespace deletion |
| **Administrator** | Full access except billing |
| **Operator** | Connect to devices, manage device settings |
| **Observer** | Read-only access, can connect to devices |

Invite team members by email and assign roles per namespace.

## API access

Automate ShellHub with the REST API. Generate API keys scoped to a namespace and role, then use them to manage devices, keys, and settings programmatically:

```bash
$ curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    https://cloud.shellhub.io/api/devices
```
