# FAQ

## What is ShellHub?

ShellHub is a centralized SSH gateway for remote access to Linux devices. See the [Introduction](/v2/docs/getting-started/introduction) for a full overview of what it does and how it works.

## Is ShellHub free?

The Community Edition is free and open source (Apache 2.0 license). You can self-host it on your own infrastructure at no cost.

ShellHub Cloud offers a free tier with limited devices. Paid plans are available for larger fleets.

Enterprise pricing is available by contacting the ShellHub team.

## Is it secure?

All connections between the agent and the ShellHub server are encrypted over HTTPS/WSS (TLS). SSH sessions are end-to-end encrypted using standard SSH protocol encryption.

ShellHub supports public key authentication, firewall rules, multi-factor authentication, and audit logging to help enforce your security policies.

The agent connects outbound from the device — no inbound ports need to be opened, reducing the attack surface.

## Which Linux distributions are supported?

The agent runs on any Linux distribution. The default installation method uses Docker, which works on Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora, Alpine, Arch, and any distro with Docker or Podman installed.

Native packages are available for:
- **Snap** — Ubuntu, Ubuntu Core, and other Snap-enabled distros
- **FreeBSD** — Via the ports collection
- **Buildroot** — Custom embedded Linux images
- **Yocto** — Custom embedded Linux images via meta-shellhub layer
- **WSL** — Windows Subsystem for Linux

You can also [build from source](/v2/docs/developers/agent-development) for any platform with Go 1.24+.

## Which architectures does the agent support?

The Docker-based agent supports:
- `amd64` (x86_64)
- `arm64` (aarch64)
- `armv7` (32-bit ARM, e.g. Raspberry Pi 3/4 with 32-bit OS)
- `armv6` (e.g. Raspberry Pi Zero)

## Can I self-host ShellHub?

Yes. The Community Edition is fully self-hosted using Docker Compose. See the [Quick Start](/v2/docs/getting-started/quick-start#self-hosted) for setup instructions.

The Enterprise Edition can also be self-hosted with additional features and support.

## What ports does ShellHub need?

Server: TCP 80/443 (web + API) and TCP 22 (SSH, configurable). Device agent: outbound HTTPS only, no inbound ports. See [Network requirements](/v2/docs/getting-started/how-it-works#network-requirements) for details.

## Can I use my existing SSH keys?

Yes. Upload your SSH public keys to ShellHub and use them to authenticate. You can scope keys by username, hostname, or device tag.

```bash
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@device.namespace@cloud.shellhub.io
```

## What's the difference between ShellHub and a VPN?

A VPN creates a network tunnel between your machine and a remote network. ShellHub provides SSH access to specific devices without creating a full network tunnel.

Key differences:

| | ShellHub | VPN |
|---|---|---|
| Setup per device | Install agent (1 command) | Configure VPN client and server |
| Network changes | None — outbound HTTPS only | Often requires firewall and routing changes |
| Access scope | SSH to specific devices | Full network access |
| Works behind CGNAT | Yes | Often no |
| Audit logging | Built-in | Requires separate tooling |

ShellHub is not a replacement for a VPN if you need full network-level access. It's purpose-built for SSH access to devices.

## How do I update the agent?

If you installed the agent via Docker (the default method), the agent container updates automatically when you re-run the install command. For Snap installations, use `sudo snap refresh shellhub`. For other methods, pull the latest source and rebuild.

For self-hosted server updates, see the [Upgrading](/v2/docs/self-hosted/upgrading) guide.
