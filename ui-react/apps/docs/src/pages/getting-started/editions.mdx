# Editions

ShellHub comes in three editions. All share the same core — the difference is in deployment model, advanced features, and support.

## Community

The open-source edition. Self-hosted, free forever.

- Full source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/shellhub-io/shellhub)
- Deploy with Docker Compose on your own infrastructure
- Core features: native SSH, web terminal, SCP/SFTP, public key auth, namespaces, device tagging
- Community support via GitHub Issues and Discussions

Community is the right choice if you want full control over your infrastructure and don't need the advanced features.

## Cloud

Managed by the ShellHub team. No infrastructure to provision or maintain.

- Sign up at [cloud.shellhub.io](https://cloud.shellhub.io) and start connecting devices in minutes
- Free tier available — pay as you grow
- Includes all features: session recording, audit logging, firewall rules, MFA, HTTP tunnels, container access
- Automatic updates, backups, and high availability
- Managed support

Cloud is the fastest way to get started. No Docker, no server setup — just install the agent on your devices and connect.

## Enterprise

For teams that need SAML/SSO, advanced audit controls, and priority support — with the flexibility to self-host or use a managed deployment.

- Everything in Cloud, plus:
  - SAML/SSO authentication (integrate with your identity provider)
  - Advanced audit and compliance features
  - Priority support
  - Custom deployment options (self-hosted or managed)

Contact the [ShellHub team](https://www.shellhub.io) for Enterprise pricing and deployment options.
