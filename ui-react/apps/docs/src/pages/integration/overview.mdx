# Integrations

ShellHub works with the tools you already use. Because every device is reachable through a standard SSH connection via the ShellHub gateway, anything that speaks SSH can connect to your devices — no special plugins or proprietary protocols required.

## What you can integrate

| Integration | What it does |
|---|---|
| [Ansible](/v2/docs/integration/ansible) | Automate configuration management and deployments across your fleet |
| [Terraform](/v2/docs/integration/terraform) | Provision infrastructure with the agent pre-installed |
| [CI/CD Pipelines](/v2/docs/integration/ci-cd) | Deploy, test, or provision devices from GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and other pipelines |
| [VS Code Remote SSH](/v2/docs/integration/vscode-remote) | Develop directly on remote devices from VS Code |

## How integrations work

All SSH-based integrations follow the same pattern:

1. Connect to the ShellHub gateway (e.g., `cloud.shellhub.io`) on port 22
2. Use the device's SSHID as the target: `username@device.namespace`
3. Authenticate with password or public key

The gateway routes the connection to the correct device through the agent's reverse tunnel. From the client's perspective, it behaves like a normal SSH connection.

```bash
$ ssh user@device.namespace@cloud.shellhub.io
```

## Public key authentication

For automation workflows (Ansible, CI/CD), public key authentication avoids storing passwords in scripts or environment variables:

1. Upload your public key in the ShellHub dashboard under **Public Keys**
2. Scope the key to specific usernames, hostnames, or device tags
3. Use the corresponding private key in your automation tool

See [Public Keys](/v2/docs/guides/public-keys) for setup details.
