# VS Code Remote SSH

Develop directly on your remote devices using VS Code's Remote - SSH extension. Edit files, run terminals, debug applications, and use extensions — all running on the remote device through ShellHub.

## Prerequisites

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension installed
- An SSH key uploaded to ShellHub (see [Public Keys](/v2/docs/guides/public-keys))
- A device connected and accepted in ShellHub

## SSH config

Add your ShellHub devices to your SSH config file (`~/.ssh/config`):

```
Host my-device
    HostName cloud.shellhub.io
    User root@device-name.my-namespace
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    Port 22
```

Replace:
- `my-device` — A friendly name for this connection (shown in VS Code)
- `root` — The SSH username on the device
- `device-name.my-namespace` — The device's SSHID (hostname + namespace)
- `cloud.shellhub.io` — Your ShellHub server address

> **Note:** For self-hosted instances, replace `cloud.shellhub.io` with your server address.

## Connecting

1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and type **Remote-SSH: Connect to Host**
3. Select `my-device` from the list
4. VS Code opens a new window connected to the remote device

You can now open folders, edit files, run the integrated terminal, and install extensions that run on the device.

## Multiple devices

Add one entry per device in your SSH config:

```
Host edge-gateway
    HostName cloud.shellhub.io
    User admin@gateway.production
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Host dev-board
    HostName cloud.shellhub.io
    User root@rpi4.lab
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

All devices appear in VS Code's Remote Explorer panel for quick access.

## Port forwarding

VS Code automatically forwards ports when you run servers on the remote device. If you start a web server on port 3000, VS Code detects it and offers to open it in your local browser.

This works through the SSH tunnel — no additional configuration in ShellHub is needed.

## Tips

- **Extensions**: Install language servers, linters, and debuggers on the remote side. VS Code handles the separation between local (UI) and remote (workspace) extensions automatically.
- **Settings sync**: Your VS Code settings sync across local and remote sessions.
- **Terminal**: The integrated terminal runs on the remote device. Use it for builds, tests, and shell commands.
- **Workspace trust**: VS Code prompts you to trust the remote workspace on first connection. This is a VS Code security feature, not a ShellHub limitation.
