# Tags

Tags are labels you assign to devices to organize your fleet. Use them to group by environment, location, role, or anything that fits your workflow.

## Assigning tags

Open a device's details page and add tags in the tag field. Each device supports up to 3 tags. Tag names can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

## Filtering

On the **Devices** page, click a tag to filter the list. Combine tags for more specific views.

## Tags + public keys

Tags are especially useful with [public key authentication](/v2/docs/guides/public-keys). When you create a public key, you can restrict it to devices with specific tags.

For example:

- Tag production servers with `production`, staging with `staging`
- Create a deploy key filtered to `production` — it only works on production devices
- Create a dev key filtered to `staging` — it only works on staging devices

This gives you environment-level access control without managing individual device permissions.

## Common patterns

| Tags | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `production`, `staging`, `dev` | Environment separation |
| `us-east`, `eu-west` | Geographic location |
| `web`, `database`, `worker` | Server role |

## Managing tags

Tags can be added or removed at any time without affecting device connectivity. Removing a tag immediately updates any public key filters that reference it.
