# Device Management

Devices are Linux machines running the ShellHub agent. Once connected, you can monitor their status, organize them with tags, and open SSH sessions from anywhere.

## Lifecycle

Every device goes through a simple lifecycle:

1. **Pending** — The agent registered with ShellHub, but the device hasn't been approved yet
2. **Accepted** — Approved and ready for SSH connections
3. **Rejected** — Explicitly denied access

New devices always start as pending. You must manually accept them before anyone can connect. This prevents unauthorized devices from joining your namespace.

## Device information

Each device reports the following through the agent:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Hostname (editable) |
| **SSHID** | Unique identifier for SSH connections |
| **MAC address** | Network interface identifier |
| **OS** | Operating system and version |
| **Architecture** | CPU arch (amd64, arm64, armv7, etc.) |
| **Last seen** | Last heartbeat timestamp |
| **Status** | Online or offline |

## SSHID

Every accepted device gets a unique SSH identifier:

```
<username>@<namespace>.<device-name>.<server>
```

For example:

```bash
$ ssh root@myteam.web-server.shellhub.example.com
```

This works with any standard SSH client. See [Connecting via SSH](/v2/docs/guides/connecting) for details.

## Accepting and rejecting

From the **Devices** page:

- **Pending** tab — Accept or reject new devices
- **Accepted** tab — View active devices, remove access if needed
- **Rejected** tab — Re-accept previously rejected devices

## Renaming

You can rename a device from the device details page without affecting the underlying hostname. Names must be unique within a namespace and can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

## Removing

Removing a device reverts it to pending. The agent keeps running on the device, but it can't receive connections until re-accepted. To fully disconnect, uninstall the agent from the device.
