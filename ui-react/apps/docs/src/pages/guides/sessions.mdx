# Sessions

Every SSH connection through ShellHub is tracked as a session. You get visibility into who connected to which device, when, and for how long.

## Viewing sessions

The **Sessions** page lists all sessions in the current namespace:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Device** | Target device name |
| **Username** | Linux user used to authenticate |
| **IP address** | Client's source IP |
| **Started** | Session start time |
| **Last seen** | Last activity timestamp |
| **Status** | Active or closed |

## Active vs. closed

- **Active** — Connection is open, user is connected
- **Closed** — Session ended (user disconnected or connection dropped)

## Session recording

Sessions can be recorded for auditing and compliance. When enabled, ShellHub captures all terminal I/O and lets you replay sessions in the dashboard.

See [Session Recording](/v2/docs/guides/session-recording) for setup and details.
