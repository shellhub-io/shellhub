# Connecting via SSH

ShellHub gives you two ways to reach your devices: a web terminal in the dashboard and native SSH client support.

## Web terminal

From the **Devices** page, click the terminal icon next to any online device. A browser-based terminal opens with full shell access — no software to install on your workstation.

Supports copy/paste, terminal resizing, and multiple simultaneous tabs.

## Native SSH

Connect with any standard SSH client using the device's SSHID — a virtual address that routes your connection through ShellHub to the right device.

> **New to SSHID?** It's ShellHub's virtual addressing system for SSH. [See how it works →](/v2/docs/getting-started/how-it-works#sshid--virtual-hosting-for-ssh)

### SSHID format

```
<username>@<namespace>.<device-name>.<server>
```

### OpenSSH

```bash
$ ssh root@myteam.web-server.shellhub.example.com
```

If your server uses a non-default SSH port:

```bash
$ ssh -p 2222 root@myteam.web-server.shellhub.example.com
```

### SSH config

Add devices to `~/.ssh/config` for quicker access:

```
Host web-server
    HostName shellhub.example.com
    User root@myteam.web-server
    Port 22
```

Then:

```bash
$ ssh web-server
```

## Authentication

**Password** — Enter the device's local user password when prompted. Works for any user account on the device.

**Public key** — If you've uploaded your SSH key to ShellHub, authentication happens without a password. See [Public Keys](/v2/docs/guides/public-keys).

## Next steps

- [File Transfer](/v2/docs/guides/file-transfer) — SCP, SFTP, and rsync through ShellHub
- [Port Forwarding](/v2/docs/guides/port-forwarding) — SSH tunnels to access remote services locally

## Troubleshooting

**Connection refused** — Check that the device is online in the dashboard and the SSH port matches your server config.

**Permission denied** — Verify the username and password. For public keys, check the key is uploaded and its filters allow access to this device.

**Timeout** — Make sure the ShellHub server is reachable and the SSH port isn't blocked on the client side.
