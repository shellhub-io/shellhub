# Settings

Namespace settings control behavior that applies to all devices and sessions within the namespace. Only the Owner and Administrators can modify settings.

## Session recording

<EditionBanner />

When enabled, ShellHub records all terminal I/O during SSH sessions. Recordings can be replayed in the dashboard for auditing, compliance, and troubleshooting.

Toggle **Session Recording** to start capturing new sessions. Existing sessions are not affected.

See [Session Recording](/v2/docs/guides/session-recording) for details on playback, storage, and privacy considerations.

## Connection announcement

Display a message to users before they connect to a device. Use it to notify about maintenance windows, acceptable use policies, or recording notices.

When set, users see the announcement text before their SSH session starts.

## MFA requirement

<EditionBanner />

When enabled, all namespace members must have multi-factor authentication configured on their account. Members without MFA will be prompted to set it up before they can access the namespace.

## Device limits

View the maximum number of devices allowed in this namespace based on your plan. The dashboard shows current usage against the limit.

| Edition | Default limit |
|---------|--------------|
| Community | 3 devices |
| Cloud | Based on subscription |
| Enterprise | Unlimited |
