# Session Recording

<EditionBanner />

ShellHub can record all terminal I/O during SSH sessions. Every keystroke, command output, and timing is captured — then you can replay sessions in the dashboard exactly as they happened.

## Enabling recording

Session recording is configured per namespace:

1. Go to **Settings** in the dashboard
2. Toggle **Session Recording** on
3. All new SSH sessions in this namespace will be recorded

Existing sessions are not affected. Recording starts from the moment you enable it.

## Viewing recordings

Recorded sessions display a play icon on the **Sessions** page. Click it to open the player.

The player replays terminal output in real time — you see exactly what the user saw, including:

- Commands typed
- Command output and responses
- Timing between keystrokes
- Terminal resizing

You can pause, resume, and scrub through the recording timeline.

## What gets recorded

| Recorded | Not recorded |
|----------|-------------|
| All terminal output (stdout/stderr) | File transfer content (SCP/SFTP payloads) |
| Commands typed (stdin) | Port forwarding traffic |
| Terminal resize events | |
| Session start/end timestamps | |

## Use cases

### Security audit

Review commands executed on sensitive systems. If an incident occurs, you have a complete record of what happened during every session.

### Compliance

Maintain access records for regulatory requirements like SOC 2, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS. Session recordings provide evidence that access was authorized and appropriate.

### Training

Record standard operating procedures and share the recordings with team members. New engineers can see exactly how experienced operators handle common tasks.

### Incident response

When something goes wrong, replay the session to understand the sequence of events. No more guessing what commands were run or relying on shell history.

## Storage

Recordings are stored on the ShellHub server. Storage usage depends on session activity — text-based terminal sessions are compact, but long or high-output sessions (e.g., compiling, streaming logs) generate more data.

For self-hosted deployments, monitor your storage usage and consider retention policies for old recordings.

## Privacy considerations

Session recording captures everything displayed in the terminal. This may include sensitive data like passwords typed in interactive prompts, environment variables, or file contents viewed with `cat`.

Make sure your team knows recording is enabled. Consider:

- Enabling recording only for namespaces that require it
- Using [connection announcements](/v2/docs/guides/settings#connection-announcement) to notify users
- Defining data retention policies that align with your compliance requirements
