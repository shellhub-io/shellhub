# Web Endpoints

Access HTTP services running on your devices through ShellHub — without opening ports or configuring firewalls. Web endpoints create a public URL that proxies HTTP requests through the agent's existing connection.

## How it works

1. A device runs an HTTP service on a local port (e.g., `:8080`)
2. You create a web endpoint in ShellHub pointing to that port
3. ShellHub generates a public URL that routes requests through the gateway to the device

No additional ports are opened on the device. Traffic flows through the same outbound WebSocket connection the agent already maintains.

## Creating a web endpoint

In the ShellHub dashboard:

1. Go to **Devices** and select the device
2. Click the **Web Endpoints** tab
3. Click **Add Endpoint**
4. Enter the local port of the service on the device (e.g., `8080`)
5. Click **Create**

ShellHub generates a unique URL like:

```
https://abcdef1234.tunnel.cloud.shellhub.io
```

Open this URL in your browser to access the service running on the device.

## Use cases

- **Web dashboards** — Access Grafana, Prometheus, Node-RED, or any monitoring tool running on edge devices
- **Admin panels** — Reach device configuration interfaces without VPN or port forwarding
- **API endpoints** — Expose REST APIs running on devices for testing or integration
- **Development** — Preview web applications running on remote machines

## Limitations

- HTTP traffic only — web endpoints proxy HTTP/HTTPS, not arbitrary TCP
- The device must be online and connected to ShellHub
- Endpoint URLs are unique per endpoint and change when recreated
- Each endpoint maps to a single port on the device

## Security

- Endpoint URLs are randomly generated and not guessable
- Access control follows your ShellHub namespace permissions
- Traffic between the client and ShellHub gateway is encrypted (HTTPS)
- Traffic between the gateway and the device flows through the agent's encrypted WebSocket tunnel
