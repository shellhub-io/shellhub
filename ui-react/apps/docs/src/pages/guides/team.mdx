# Team

The Team page is where you manage who has access to your namespace and what they can do. It has two sections: **Members** and **API Keys**.

## Members

Members are users who have access to the current namespace. Each member has a role that determines their permissions.

### Adding a member

1. Go to **Team** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add Member**
3. Enter the user's username (they need an existing ShellHub account)
4. Select a role
5. Click **Add Member**

The user gets access immediately — no invitation flow, no email confirmation.

### Roles

| Role | Devices | Sessions | Keys & Rules | Members | Settings |
|------|---------|----------|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Owner** | Full | Full | Full | Full | Full |
| **Administrator** | Full | Full | Full | Add/Remove | Edit |
| **Operator** | Connect | View | View | — | — |
| **Observer** | View only | View | View | — | — |

**Owner** — Full control over the namespace, including deleting it. Each namespace has exactly one owner. Ownership cannot be transferred through the UI.

**Administrator** — Can manage devices, keys, firewall rules, and members. Cannot delete the namespace or change the owner.

**Operator** — Can connect to devices and view resources. Cannot create, edit, or delete anything.

**Observer** — Read-only access. Can view devices, sessions, and keys but cannot connect or modify anything.

### Editing a member's role

Hover over a member row and click the edit icon. Select the new role and save. Role changes take effect immediately.

### Removing a member

Hover over a member row and click the delete icon. The member loses access to the namespace immediately. This does not delete their ShellHub account — they can still access other namespaces they belong to.

> You cannot edit or remove the namespace owner, and you cannot edit or remove yourself.

## API Keys

API keys let you authenticate with the ShellHub REST API without using your personal credentials. Use them for CI/CD pipelines, automation scripts, Terraform, Ansible, and other integrations.

### Generating a key

1. Switch to the **API Keys** tab
2. Click **Generate Key**
3. Enter a name (e.g. `ci-pipeline`, `terraform-prod`)
4. Select a role — the key inherits the same permissions as that role
5. Set an expiration (30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 1 year, or never)
6. Click **Generate Key**

> Copy the key immediately. You won't be able to see it again after closing the drawer.

### Using a key

Pass the API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>" \
  https://shellhub.example.com/api/devices
```

Or with the ShellHub CLI and integrations that accept an API key.

### Key roles

API keys follow the same role permissions as members:

- **Administrator** — Full API access (create, update, delete resources)
- **Operator** — Read access plus connect
- **Observer** — Read-only API access

Choose the least privilege needed for your use case. A CI pipeline that only reads device status needs Observer, not Administrator.

### Expiration

Expired keys stop working immediately. The Team page shows an **Expired** badge on keys past their expiration date.

Set shorter expirations for keys used in less trusted environments. Use "Never" only for long-lived infrastructure automation where rotating keys is impractical.

### Editing and deleting keys

You can rename a key or change its role at any time. Deleting a key revokes it immediately — any integration using it will get authentication errors.
