# Namespaces

A namespace is an isolated workspace. Each one has its own devices, SSH keys, firewall rules, sessions, and team members. Everything in ShellHub lives inside a namespace.

Use namespaces to separate environments, projects, teams, or customers on a single ShellHub server.

## Creating a namespace

Your first namespace is created when you set up ShellHub. To create additional namespaces:

1. Click the namespace selector in the dashboard header
2. Select **Create Namespace**
3. Pick a name — lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens

> Pick a short name. It becomes part of every device's SSH address.

## Switching namespaces

Click the namespace selector in the header to see all namespaces you belong to. Select one to switch — the dashboard, devices, sessions, and all other pages update to show that namespace's data.

## What's inside a namespace

| Resource | Scoped to namespace? |
|----------|---------------------|
| Devices | Yes — each device belongs to one namespace |
| Sessions | Yes — session history is per namespace |
| Public keys | Yes — keys are scoped to the namespace |
| Firewall rules | Yes — rules apply within the namespace |
| Tags | Yes — tags exist within a namespace |
| Web endpoints | Yes — endpoints are per namespace |
| Team members | Yes — members and roles are per namespace |
| Settings | Yes — recording, announcements, MFA are per namespace |

A user can be a member of multiple namespaces with different roles in each.

## Namespace in SSHIDs

The namespace is part of every device's SSHID:

```
<username>@<namespace>.<device-name>.<server>
```

For example:

```bash
$ ssh root@myteam.web-server.shellhub.example.com
```

Here `myteam` is the namespace. Your team will type it in every SSH command, so keep it short and descriptive.

## Deleting a namespace

Only the owner can delete a namespace. This permanently removes all devices, keys, firewall rules, session history, and member access. The action is irreversible.
