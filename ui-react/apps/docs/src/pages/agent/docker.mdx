# Docker

The default and recommended way to install the ShellHub agent. Requires Docker or Podman on the device.

## Installation

### From the dashboard

The easiest method. In the ShellHub dashboard, click **Add Device** and copy the install script command:

```bash
$ curl -sSf "https://cloud.shellhub.io/install.sh?tenant_id=YOUR_TENANT_ID" | sh
```

> **Note:** For self-hosted instances, replace `cloud.shellhub.io` with your server address.

This downloads and runs the agent as a Docker container with automatic restart on reboot.

### Manual Docker run

If you prefer to run the container manually:

```bash
$ docker run -d \
    --name shellhub-agent \
    --restart always \
    --privileged \
    --net host \
    --pid host \
    -v /:/host \
    -v /dev:/dev \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -e SHELLHUB_SERVER_ADDRESS=https://cloud.shellhub.io \
    -e SHELLHUB_TENANT_ID=YOUR_TENANT_ID \
    -e SHELLHUB_PRIVATE_KEY=/host/etc/shellhub.key \
    shellhubio/agent
```

The `--privileged` and `--net host` flags are required for the agent to manage SSH sessions and access the host's network stack.

> **Note:** For self-hosted instances, replace `cloud.shellhub.io` with your server address in `SHELLHUB_SERVER_ADDRESS`.

## Updating

Pull the latest image and recreate the container:

```bash
$ docker pull shellhubio/agent
$ docker rm -f shellhub-agent
```

Then re-run the install command or the manual Docker run command above.

## Verifying

Check the agent is running:

```bash
$ docker ps | grep shellhub-agent
```

Check agent logs:

```bash
$ docker logs shellhub-agent
```

The device should appear in the ShellHub dashboard with **Pending** status. Click **Accept** to approve it.

## Supported architectures

The Docker image supports:

- `amd64` (x86_64)
- `arm64` (aarch64)
- `armv7` (32-bit ARM, e.g., Raspberry Pi 3/4)
- `armv6` (e.g., Raspberry Pi Zero)

Docker automatically pulls the correct architecture for your device.
