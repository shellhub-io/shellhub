# Snap

Install the ShellHub agent as a Snap package on Ubuntu, Ubuntu Core, or any Linux distribution with Snap support.

## Installation

```bash
$ sudo snap install --classic shellhub
```

The `--classic` flag is required because the agent needs access to the host's network and filesystem.

## Configuration

Set the required configuration values:

```bash
$ sudo snap set shellhub server-address=https://cloud.shellhub.io
$ sudo snap set shellhub tenant-id=YOUR_TENANT_ID
```

> **Note:** For self-hosted instances, replace `cloud.shellhub.io` with your server address.

View the current configuration:

```bash
$ sudo snap get shellhub
```

### Available settings

| Setting | Required | Description |
|---------|:--------:|-------------|
| `server-address` | Yes | ShellHub server URL |
| `tenant-id` | Yes | Your namespace's tenant ID |
| `private-key` | No | Path to the agent's private key file |
| `preferred-hostname` | No | Override the device hostname |

## Managing the service

```bash
$ sudo snap start shellhub     # Start the agent
$ sudo snap stop shellhub      # Stop the agent
$ sudo snap restart shellhub   # Restart the agent
$ sudo snap logs shellhub      # View agent logs
```

## Updating

Snap updates automatically. To force an update:

```bash
$ sudo snap refresh shellhub
```

## Verifying

After configuration, the device appears in the ShellHub dashboard with **Pending** status. Click **Accept** to approve it.
