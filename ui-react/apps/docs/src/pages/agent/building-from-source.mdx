# Building from Source

Build the ShellHub agent from source for platforms without a pre-built package, custom integrations, or development.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- Git

## Building

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/shellhub-io/shellhub.git
$ cd shellhub/agent
$ go build -o shellhub-agent
```

This produces a single binary: `shellhub-agent`.

## Running

Configure the agent with environment variables and run it:

```bash
$ export SHELLHUB_SERVER_ADDRESS=https://cloud.shellhub.io
$ export SHELLHUB_TENANT_ID=YOUR_TENANT_ID
$ export SHELLHUB_PRIVATE_KEY=/etc/shellhub.key
$ ./shellhub-agent
```

> **Note:** For self-hosted instances, replace `cloud.shellhub.io` with your server address.

For local development against a [development instance](/v2/docs/developers/development-environment):

```bash
$ export SHELLHUB_SERVER_ADDRESS=http://localhost
$ export SHELLHUB_TENANT_ID=00000000-0000-4000-0000-000000000000
$ export SHELLHUB_PRIVATE_KEY=/tmp/shellhub-dev.key
$ ./shellhub-agent
```

## Supported architectures

The agent compiles on any platform supported by Go:

- `amd64` (x86_64)
- `arm64` (aarch64)
- `arm` (32-bit ARM)
- `386` (32-bit x86)
- `riscv64`

## Limitations

The native binary does **not** support:

- **Auto-update** — only the Docker install method auto-updates the agent when the server version changes
- **Connector mode** — requires Docker to manage containers
