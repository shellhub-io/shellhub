# Raspberry Pi

Install the ShellHub agent on a Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS (Debian-based). Once installed, you can SSH into your Pi from anywhere through ShellHub — no port forwarding, no dynamic DNS, no VPN.

## Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi (any model: Zero, 3, 4, 5) running Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit or 64-bit)
- Internet connection on the Pi
- A ShellHub account with a namespace

## Install with the install script

The fastest way. SSH into your Pi (or open a terminal) and run:

```bash
$ curl -sSf https://cloud.shellhub.io/install.sh | sh
```

The script detects your Pi's architecture (armhf or arm64) and installs the appropriate agent binary.

For self-hosted ShellHub, pass your server address:

```bash
$ curl -sSf https://your-server.example.com/install.sh | sh
```

After installation, the agent starts automatically and the Pi appears as **Pending** in the ShellHub dashboard. Accept it to start connecting.

## Install with Docker

If your Pi has Docker installed:

```bash
$ docker run -d \
  --name shellhub-agent \
  --restart always \
  --privileged \
  --net host \
  --pid host \
  -v /:/host \
  -v /dev:/dev \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /etc/shellhub:/etc/shellhub \
  -e SERVER_ADDRESS=https://cloud.shellhub.io \
  -e TENANT_ID=<your-tenant-id> \
  shellhubio/agent
```

Replace `<your-tenant-id>` with your namespace's tenant ID (found in the namespace selector or Settings page).

See the [Docker guide](/v2/docs/agent/docker) for more options.

## Install with Snap

On Ubuntu-based Raspberry Pi OS or Ubuntu Server for Pi:

```bash
$ sudo snap install shellhub-agent
$ sudo snap set shellhub-agent server-address=https://cloud.shellhub.io
$ sudo snap set shellhub-agent tenant-id=<your-tenant-id>
$ sudo snap start shellhub-agent
```

See the [Snap guide](/v2/docs/agent/snap) for details.

## Connecting to your Pi

Once the agent is running and the device is accepted:

**Web terminal** — Click the terminal icon next to your Pi on the Devices page.

**Native SSH** — Use the SSHID:

```bash
$ ssh pi@mynamespace.raspberrypi.cloud.shellhub.io
```

Replace `pi` with your Pi's username, `mynamespace` with your namespace, and `raspberrypi` with the device hostname shown in the dashboard.

## Headless setup

For Pis deployed without a monitor or keyboard, install the agent as part of your provisioning process:

1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS to an SD card
2. Enable SSH on first boot (create an empty `ssh` file in the boot partition)
3. Configure Wi-Fi if needed (`wpa_supplicant.conf` in boot partition)
4. Boot the Pi and SSH in over your local network
5. Run the install script
6. Accept the device in ShellHub

From this point on, you can reach the Pi through ShellHub regardless of network changes — even if it moves to a different Wi-Fi network, gets a new IP, or goes behind a NAT.

## Embedded use cases

If you're building a custom Linux image for Raspberry Pi with Buildroot or Yocto, you can embed the agent directly into the firmware. See [Embedded Linux](/v2/docs/embedded-linux/overview) for build system integrations.

## Troubleshooting

**Agent not starting** — Check the agent logs:

```bash
$ journalctl -u shellhub-agent -f
```

Or for Docker:

```bash
$ docker logs shellhub-agent
```

**Device shows as offline** — Make sure the Pi has internet access and can reach your ShellHub server on port 443. Test with:

```bash
$ curl -I https://cloud.shellhub.io
```

**Wrong architecture** — The install script auto-detects architecture. If it fails, check with `uname -m`. Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit reports `armv7l`, 64-bit reports `aarch64`.

**Permission denied after connecting** — The default user on Raspberry Pi OS is `pi` (older images) or your custom username (newer images). Make sure you're using the correct username in the SSHID.
