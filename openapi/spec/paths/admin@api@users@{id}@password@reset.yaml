  operationId: adminResetUserPassword
  summary: Reset user password
  description: |
    Resets the password for a specified user. It's particularly useful for
    users who initially authenticated via SAML and therefore may not have a
    password set up. This enables them to maintain access even if their
    original authentication method becomes unavailable (e.g., if SAML
    authentication is disabled).

    The endpoint generates a secure 16-character random password that includes:
    - Uppercase letters
    - Lowercase letters
    - Numbers
    - Special characters

    Users are strongly encouraged to change this temporary password after their
    first successful authentication. If the user already has a password, a `400
    Bad Request` status code will be returned.
