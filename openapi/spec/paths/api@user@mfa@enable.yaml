  description: |
    Enable MFA for a user. The secret and recovery codes must be created by the
    generateMFA endpoint. Users with MFA already enabled cannot override their
    MFA credentials; in these cases, a user must disable MFA before proceeding.
    The recovery e-mail must be a valid value in order to enable the MFA.
