  Device's acceptable

  The value "acceptable" is based on the number of devices removed and already accepted into a namespace. All devices
  are "acceptable" unless the "namespace.max_devices" is reached. This limit is set based on the sum up of accepted and
  removed devices into the namespace. When this limit is reached, only removed devices between 720 hours or 30 days are
  set to "acceptable".
