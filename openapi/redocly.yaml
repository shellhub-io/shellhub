# This is the Redocly configuration file, and it is used by Redocly CLI and other Redocly apps to control their behavior
# â€” from the strictness of the lint command, to how Redocly renders your docs.
#
#   - Workflows uses it in the API registry to manage your APIs and control advanced features like region and link resolution.
#   - Workflows and on-premise tools use it to apply your features and theme when building API docs.
#   - Redocly's VS Code extension uses it for linting criteria, to apply custom settings for live documentation previews,
#   and to identify the path API definition root files.
